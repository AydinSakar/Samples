Book Samples
=======

## Sample code - chapter by chapter

Each chapter has its own folder, which will correspond to the zip file name for that chapter on submission.
Within each chapter folder is a folder for each sample.  The folder should contain enough to run the sample independent of the other samples, including tests.

We could have a common folder for libraries that we can pull from a CDN.
