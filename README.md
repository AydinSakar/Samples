Book Samples
=======

## Sample code - chapter by chapter

Each chapter has its own folder, which will correspond to the zip file name for that chapter on submission.
Within each chapter folder is a folder for each sample.  The folder should contain enough to run the sample independent of the other samples, including tests.
I have put an index (i.e. 01, 02, etc.) in front of each sample so that you can see the order in which they appear in the chapter.
Where the sample has a corresponding Plunk, I have added the Plunk ID in brackets after the name of the sample in the folder name.

We could have a common folder for libraries that we can pull from a CDN.
